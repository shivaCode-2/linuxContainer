## Overview

This beta release offers two delivery modes for trying out our LabVIEW container:

1. **Automated CI Workflow**  
   Fork and explore the companion repo at https://github.com/shivaCode-2/linuxContainer. It includes a GitHub Actions pipeline that when a Pull Request is raised,  pulls the `labview_linux:2025q3_beta` image, runs LabVIEW CLI operations on sample VIs in the repo, and validates the results.

2. **Direct Image Access**  
   Pull and run the `labview_linux:2025q3_beta` image directly in your own environment. We will add you as a contributor on the private GitHub Package Registry so you can authenticate and download the image as needed.

Both options let you adapt the container to your workflowsâ€”either by extending the provided CI setup or integrating the image into your own processes.

## Prerequisites

- Docker Engine (version 20.10+)
- At least 8 GB RAM and 4 CPU cores available
- Internet connection for downloading the container image
- Git
